## 🚀 Task 1: Student's Year of Graduation Prediction

* **Objective:** To process student lead data and calculate their expected year of graduation based on their current academic year.
* **Methodology:** This task involved data cleaning, preprocessing, and applying a logical rule-based calculation within a Jupyter Notebook.
* **Key Skills:** Data Cleaning (Pandas), Data Visualization (Plotly), Feature Engineering.

➡️ *For more details, please see the `README.md` file inside the `Task 1` folder.*

## 🤖 Task 2: AI-Powered Career Path Prediction System

* **Objective:** To build a machine learning model that predicts a suitable career path for a student based on their skills and interests, and to deploy this model in an interactive web application.
* **Methodology:** This task involved a complete machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (`RandomForestClassifier`), and building a user-friendly UI with Streamlit.
* **Key Skills:** Predictive Modeling, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Data Visualization, Feature Selection.

➡️ *For more details, please see the `README.md` file inside the `Task 2` folder.*
